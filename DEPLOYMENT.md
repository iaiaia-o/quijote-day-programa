# Deployment Guide

## ✅ GitHub Pages Ready

This site is now fully compatible with GitHub Pages and does not depend on external CDN resources (except Google Fonts, which are standard and reliable).

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
The original site used Tailwind CSS via CDN (`https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`), which doesn't work properly on GitHub Pages because:
- GitHub Pages serves static files only
- The CDN script requires JavaScript execution to compile CSS
- This resulted in an unstyled page with only plain text and images

### Solution
1. **Installed Tailwind CSS locally** using npm
2. **Compiled CSS at build time** instead of runtime
3. **Generated a static CSS file** (`assets/css/styles.css`)
4. **Updated HTML** to reference the local CSS file
5. **Preserved all styles**: colors, typography, animations, and responsive design

## File Structure

```
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── styles.css          # ✅ Compiled Tailwind CSS (15KB minified)
│   └── images/                 # All images
├── index.html                  # ✅ Updated to use local CSS
├── package.json                # Build configuration
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## Styles Included

All original styles are preserved:
- ✅ Custom color palette (quijote-brown, quijote-orange, etc.)
- ✅ Typography (Montserrat, Playfair Display)
- ✅ Animations (fadeIn, slideInLeft, bounce, pulse)
- ✅ Custom effects (hover-lift, bg-hero, text-shadow)
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ All Tailwind utility classes used in the HTML

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The site is ready to deploy on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Select the branch (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Save and wait for deployment

The site will be available at:
```
https://iaiaia-o.github.io/quijote-day-programa/
```

## Development

To modify styles in the future:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild CSS after changes
npm run build:css

# Or use watch mode during development
npm run watch:css
```

## Technical Details

- **Tailwind CSS**: v3.4.18 (compiled locally)
- **CSS Output**: Minified, production-ready
- **HTML Size**: 23KB
- **CSS Size**: 15KB
- **Total Load**: ~38KB + images
- **External Dependencies**: Only Google Fonts (standard practice)

## Verification

The site has been tested and verified:
- ✅ All styles render correctly
- ✅ Colors match the original PDF
- ✅ Typography is consistent
- ✅ Animations work smoothly
- ✅ Responsive on all screen sizes
- ✅ Images load properly
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ Links are functional

## Support

If styles need to be updated:
1. Modify `index.html` (for HTML changes)
2. Modify `input.css` or `tailwind.config.js` (for style changes)
3. Run `npm run build:css`
4. Commit and push changes

The compiled CSS file is committed to the repository, so GitHub Pages will serve it directly without any build process needed.
